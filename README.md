- 👋 Hi, I’m @uLuKaiDev, Airline Captain, gamer, nerd..
- 👀 I’m interested in Gamedevelopment via the Godot engine as well as programming in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via Boot.dev, as well as learning Python and GDScript on my own
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing just yet, this is all for learning purposes and as a fun hobby
- 📫 How to reach me: Pretty sure you can leave a messsage on github somewhere, not sure where though
- 😄 Pronouns: not important
- ⚡ Fun fact: in 2004 when I attended a college I dropped out of, the only fun thing I remember doing is creating a fully functioning working forum with html, css, php and mysql. The assignment was supposed to be just a .png as a mock-up, but I decided I was going to make the whole thing
